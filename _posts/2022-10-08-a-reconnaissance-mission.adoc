_Translated by Mattias Holm._

This story was part of an inital manuscript of a book
which was written by a number of Swedish former Caproni pilots.
The original manuscript was never published officially.
However, part of the manuscript was provided to Mikael Forslund who produced a book,
using parts of the manuscript.
The book does not include this story, however the history of the Caproni Ca.313
in the Swedish Air Force is quite interesting and I would strongly recommended
https://books.google.nl/books/about/Caproni_Ca_313_R_P_B_S.html?id=-bs9MwEACAAJ&redir_esc=y[Mikael Forslund’s Caproni book].
Most of the book is in Swedish, but a summary in the book is written in English.

Nils was a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caproni_Ca.313[Caproni Ca.313] pilot
in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Air_Force[Swedish Air Force]
during https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II[World War II].

_Comment by Carl Holm:_
Nils was telling that the commander that gave the order said
that they should deny that any order had been given if anything happened...

_Comment by Mattias Holm:_
Nils who was a conscript,
stated one time that he was given a temporary officer's pass during this mission.
That way, they would be treated better in case of being captured.

== The Date of the Event

_Comment by Mattias Holm._

The mission took place on a Sunday in august 1943.
This was after the famous commando raids against the heavy water plants
on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Freshman[19 November 1942]
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_heavy_water_sabotage#Operation_Gunnerside[early 1943],
but just before the final bombing raids at the plants
that took place on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_heavy_water_sabotage#Resumed_operation_and_Allied_air_raids[16 and 18 November].
As for the exact date of the event in this story, it would be one of the Sundays in August that year,
which would be either the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd or 29th.
It was good weather for a swim, so the temperatures need to be good.
There is
https://www.smhi.se/data/meteorologi/ladda-ner-meteorologiska-observationer[historical temperature data from SMHI].
The temperatures recorded at Vänersborg (not far from Såtenäs) were for the relevant dates the following:

.Temperatures in Vänersborg (℃)
|===
| | 07:00 UTC | 12:00 UTC | 18:00 UTC

| 1 August 1943 | 18.6 | 26.8 | 26.4
| 8 August 1943 | 15.4 | 15 | 13.4
| 15 August 1943 | 12.4 | 18 | 16.4
| 22 August 1943 | 17 | 20.4 | 22.2
| 29 August 1943 | 9.6 | 17 | 14.8
|===

NOTE: Temperature data is available from SMHI following the
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode[Creative Commons Attribution License].

So we can conclude that the flight most likely happened on either the 1st of August or the 22nd of August.
The other dates seem to cold to be offering sunny weather for swimming.

The distance between Såtenäs and Rjukan is 153 NM (283 km), of which 60 NM (111 km) was in Sweden and 93 NM (172 km) in Norway.
The minimum trip in the mission was thus 306 NM.
The Caproni had a max speed of 233 knots (430 km/h).
Thus, the minimum time of the mission would have been 1h 20min (of which 46 minutes would be in the German controlled airspace of Norway).
Obviously, actual mission time would be longer.

It is very likely that the photos taken during this mission was used to plan the bombing raids of the 16 and 18 November.
My grandfathers contribution to history...


== The Story

_As told by Nils Holm._
_Editing and translation by Mattias Holm._

I belonged to a reconnaissance group
that was stationed at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skaraborg_Wing[F 7 Såtenäs],
with the task to carry out reconnaissance on naval movements at the western coast
and monitoring of the Norwegian border.
It was a Sunday in August 1943.
We were on backup duty.
It was a wonderful day and we sought and was even given permission
to head down to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vänern[Vänern] for a swim.
It was usually not any emergencies.
The guards were notified about our availability. 

After about an hour a courier came at full speed and told us that we had to fly a a mission.
The orders were sparsely formulated.
The defense staff had received information
about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Norway[German troop movements]
in the area of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rjukan[Rjukan]
in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway[Norway] and wanted pictures.
We decided to carry out the mission at highest altitude
due to the good visibility, which can be questioned.
Due to safety reasons, the planes were not allowed to be in the hangars
with topped up oxygen bottles onboard
and the oxygen that we were supposed to bring along was in Lidköping.
As it was Sunday, the oxygen storage facility was closed.
We decided despite this to fly at highest altitude 7000 m.
Max altitude without oxygen was 5000 m.

We found our target and the scout took a series of pictures from the nose of the plane.
When we turned and the scouts throw over the camera to the other side he passed out
due to oxygen deprivation and was then laying sweetly on the floor.
I quickly left the target and turned east under a steep dive to get into more dense air.
Eventually the scout woke up and he became surprisingly alert
when we told him that we had an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Bf_109[Me 109]
far behind us on the same course.
For safety reasons we dove down to minimum altitude and was not bothered by it anymore.

We took it quite easy because we hade the understanding
that the _Me_ pilots in Norway were completely harmless.
They were supposedly rookies under schooling on the plane type.
Later they became more dangerous because
Norway was used as a recreational resort
to rehabilitate mentally exhausted pilots.

During the night, a plane had supposedly landed and took off at _F 7_.
Rumours were circulating
that it was an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Mosquito[English Mosquito]
that had picked up our photos.
Maybe we were not as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_during_World_War_II[neutral]
as they tried to tell the Swedish people.
