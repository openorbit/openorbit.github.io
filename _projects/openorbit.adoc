Open Orbit is a space flight simulator.
The current project is a conversion in progress of the original C-code to Swift.
Unlike the C-version, the Swift version utilize several dependencies on system libraries.

This includes SceneKit for rendering and rigid body simulation.
Texture based sky boxes instead of spherical point stars, etc.

Open Orbit is very early in the conversion process.
Do not expect anything fun or usable at this time (2023-03-01).

Open Orbit utilize the https://github.com/lorrden/swift-sim[`swift-sim`]
and https://github.com/lorrden/swift-celmek[`swift-celmek`] packages.
