Swift physics is a physics library written in Swift.

While it started as swift-celmek, only implementing astronomical algorithms,
It scope has since expanded, prompting a name change.

It implements a number of astronomical algorithms such as:

- VSOP87
- ELP2000 82b
- Goffin2000
- Several algorithms from Meeus' Astronomical Algorithm's.

In addition:

- Aerodynamics (atmospheric models, NACA airfoil shape calculator)

The library is tested on macOS and Linux.
