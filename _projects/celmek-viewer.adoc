CelMek Viewer is a simple macOS viewer application to interact with
and plot data produced by the
https://github.com/lorrden/swift-celmek[Swift CelMek library].

The latest build can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/lorrden/CelMek-Viewer/releases/download/latest/CelMek-Viewer.zip[CelMek Viewer.app]

NOTE: The app is NOT notarized at this time, although there is a code signature.
Launching it will thus make macOS warn about something being very bad with it.
You need to right / control-click on the app and select _Open_ after downloading, most likely two times and approve that it is opened.
